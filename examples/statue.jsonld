However, the incident did not take place in Italy - the statue in the video was part of the Ain El Fouara fountain in Setif, Algeria. Various media outlets, including an Egyptian television station, news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) and TV network France24, reported on the incident in Algeria at the time, which took place in December 2017. Reports at that time contained footage resembling the video posted recently.",

        "comment": "This incident took place in Setif, Algiers, on the 18th of December 2017 when a man, presented as mentally ill according local authorities, attacked the nude statue of the Ain El Fouara fountain (“the spring that gushes out”), with a hammer and a chisel. The Naiad statue, made in 1898 by French sculptor Francis de Saint-Vidal, is an emblematic monument of Setif. The same monument was targeted also in October 2018 when a man tried to vandalize it again before being expelled by a by-passer. At that time, the 2017 video surfaced and was presented as a footage of a muslim migrant vandalizing a Virgin Mary statue in Italy.",
